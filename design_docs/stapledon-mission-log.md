# Stapledon mission log

Append-only. One entry per iteration, newest at the bottom.

## 2026-09-27: pre-iteration 0 (attended bootstrap)

- **Built:** the M0 spike (AILANG sidecar and the physically accurate
  starfield), published `sunholo/relativity@0.1.0`, and added CI.
- **Process:** set up the design-doc → sprint → execute → evaluate cycle. Wrote
  the M1 design doc and this charter draft.
- **Upstream:** 11 AILANG reports sent through `ailang messages` (gcp store).
- **Next:** Mark ratifies the charter (or chooses to stay attended), then the
  M1 sprint plan.
- **CI:** green on ubuntu (Godot 4.7.2, AILANG v0.45.0). The strict-VM result
  on Linux x64 is bit-identical to darwin arm64 (21.392852753780428).

## 2026-09-27 (late): armed, attended

- **M1.0 review builds ✅:** `v0.1.0-m0` runs on Mark's laptop.
- **Mark's grants:** standing permission to publish `sunholo/relativity` and to
  cut review releases. Arm the loop, with live missions fleet, world and
  stapledon.
- **Registration:** `sunholo-data/ailang#1340`. Dry run OK (own pidfile,
  lanes ok, evaluator provider ≠ executor). Bookkeeping issue #1 created.
- **Driver tests:** 92/92. One timing flake in `test_driver_notify` on the
  first run under load, green on reruns and on `origin/dev`.


## 2026-09-27 (night): iteration 0, M1.1 photometry package LANDED [PRODUCT]

- **Pick:** queue head M1 → sprint R1-M1-SKY milestone M1.1 (`sunholo/relativity@0.2.0`
  photometry). Clause 1, UNMET. Charter iteration-0 ratification filed as D-1 (not
  blocking: Mark armed the loop and granted loop publishing after the draft footer).
- **Outcome:** LANDED. Package PR sunholo-data/ailang-packages#81 (`e40f14b`, `01307ee`),
  published `sunholo/relativity@0.2.0` (content sha256:1af50b9d…); game PR #2 merged
  `b258222`, CI green on the merge commit (strict VM 21.392852753780428, parity 601 lines).
  Evaluator Sonnet **86/100 PASS**, no blocking findings.
- **Progress:** R1 clauses 1–4 UNMET, 5 ongoing. M1: 2 of 8 milestones done (M1.0, M1.1).
- **Built:** `photometry.ail` (teffFromBpRp, gMinusV, bpRpInTable, vFromG,
  illuminanceFromV, fluxRatioFromMags), generated `photometry_table.ail` from Mamajek
  v2022.04.16 via `tools/mamajek_to_ail.py`, 7 new tests (47/47 on v0.45.0 and v0.47.0).
- **Premises corrected (measured):** Mamajek BP−RP spans B9V–M9.5V, not O–L, and reverses
  at M9V (2 rows dropped); Mamajek vs Riello G−V differs 0.1015 mag at BP−RP 3.0, so the
  design's 0.05 mag AC was unmeetable → 0.11 over 0.4–3.0 plus 0.05 over 0.4–1.3 (D-2).
  The controller's own first tolerance (0.10, from node values only) was also wrong; the
  executor caught it between nodes. Sirius A and α Cen B are not in Gaia DR3; their test
  inputs are B−V transformed through the same table (disclosed, partly circular).
- **Evaluator findings actioned:** CHANGELOG tolerance (a controller replace had silently not
  matched) and the F–K comment (sweep max 0.048 mag, not 0.034). **Carried to M1.2:**
  interpolation is an O(n²) `nth_or` scan per lookup; 331k rows need Array[float] + binary search.
- **Routing evidence:** base=b2582221142cec2c2dc7808246e4be1cd6bf6424@2026-09-27T21:08:05Z (by hand:
  `mission-base.sh` cannot resolve origin/dev, ticket `mission-base:hardcoded-origin-dev`).
  Controller `claude-opus-5-5` (tok: not reported) · designer not spawned (approved M1 design
  doc exists) · planner not spawned (approved sprint plan exists; resolver said
  `agent-tool opus fail-closed:planner-lane-field-missing`) · executor `codex:gpt-6-sol`
  via recipe, probe rc=0, run rc=0 (66,074 tok) · evaluator `sonnet` via Agent tool
  (127,992 tok), provider ≠ executor.
- **Ruled out:** a Gaia DR3 cone search for Sirius and α Cen A/B (no sources: too bright);
  strict-VM probe of photometry (`println` is Phase 2E, evaluator-only), non-strict VM
  output byte-identical to the interpreter instead.
- **Cost:** metered $0 · quota buckets: codex (executor), sonnet (evaluator), opus (controller).
- **Next:** M1.2 catalogue pipeline (needs D-3/D-4 defaults; plan on v0.47) ∥ M1.6 free motion.
